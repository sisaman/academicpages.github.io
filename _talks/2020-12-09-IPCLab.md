Abstract:  

From protein design and neuroscience to the study of social networks, the solution to some of the boldest problems of our time hinges on modeling interactions between objects---something that graphs are ideal for. In the past few years, the machine learning research over graphs has been revolutionized with the emergence of graph-based deep learning models, called graph neural networks (GNNs), which have demonstrated superior performance in the automatic learning of graph representation for various downstream tasks. However, learning over graphs can raise privacy concerns when they represent sensitive interactions or contain personal information. Previous works on privacy-preserving machine learning have presented effective solutions to protect the privacy of users when dealing with euclidean data, such as image, audio, and text, but addressing the privacy issues involved in applying deep learning algorithms on graphs is often more challenging due to the existing connectivity between graph nodes. This talk aims to give a gentle introduction to graph neural networks and the potential privacy risks of applying GNNs over sensitive graphs. Then, an overview of possible privacy attacks on GNNs and the most recent attempts to build privacy-preserving GNNs will be presented. The talk will conclude with a short discussion of key open problems and emerging research directions.
