I am a second-year PhD student in the School of Engineering at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/home/) and a research assistant in the Social Computing group at [Idiap Research Institute](http://idiap.ch) under the supervision of [Prof. Daniel Gatica-Perez](https://www.idiap.ch/~gatica/). I am also a member of [Digital Humanities Institute](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/research-2/dhi/) at EPFL, and [dhCenter](https://www.dhcenter-unil-epfl.ch/), the UNIL-EPFL joint center for digital humanities. My academic research interest lies at the intersection of privacy, machine learning, and social network analysis. More specifically, I work on designing privacy-preserving representation learning algorithms for large-scale graphs such as social and information networks. I am keen to initiate any kind of academic collaborations, so if you have similar research interests, please feel free to drop me a message!
